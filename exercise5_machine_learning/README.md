## Setup (Optional)

> **NOTE**: This setup is only required if you don't want to run the architecture using Docker and you prefer to install it yourself. At your own risk. :-)

* Jupyter Notebook install instructions: https://jupyter.org/install
	* If you have Admin rights, install Anacoda framework: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
	* If you don't have admin rights install portable python: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and follow installation instructions on https://jupyter.org/install
	* Install several  modules for the notebook:
		* `pip install elasticsearch`
		* `pip install matplotlib`
		* `pip install sklearn`

* Launch Jupyter notebook:
  * Run following on comand line `jupyter notebook`
  * Open it on the browser: http://localhost:8888

## Development

> **NOTE**: If you are using the Docker instance, you will have to run it using the token. Just look at the "jupyter" service logs for the full URL (including the token).

* Load notebook and follow the instructions there.
